_Editor's note: It looks like I was trying to actually make a website where you can
actually edit stuff and it reacts to inputs and save them and stuff. Huh. Well, anyway,
I experimented with this stuff and it never happened._

## architecture
-	node
-	mongoose + mongodb
-	express
-	react
-	draft.js
-	bootstrap and/or flexbox

## questions

-	common stuff on top of express? ease of API creation? middleware?
	something useful without using a full-blown MVC (fe? be?) framework?
	should i just be using one?

-	where to store stuff? here are some possible options (zero research done,
	just googled):

	-	[cosmic.js](https://cosmicjs.com/) (seemed pretty sweet but 10MB is
		like nothing. we could put like three JPEGs on there for that much)

	-	[apostrophe](http://apostrophenow.org/)

	-	[hatch.js](http://hatchjs.com/)

	-	[keystone.js](http://keystonejs.com/) (actually this looks really
		heavy...)

	-	[ghost](https://ghost.org/) (does this just solve everything? will it
		actually cost money? maybe not customizable enough...)

	-	[cloud cms](https://www.cloudcms.com/)

	-	good free tier for GCP? paranoid about getting charged money...

	-	just use google drive and paste links?

## plan

In general get something working and then add features.

-	[ ] super rough sketch(ese)
-	[ ] &rarr; HTML
-	[ ] &rarr; react components
-	[ ] routes
-	[ ] DB object
-	[ ] auth
-	[ ] post
-	[ ] edit

## ideas

lots to think about

1.	integrations with crap. e.g. some kind of notification system.

2.	(maybe better to keep this list short for now. i'm sure there will be
	gazillions.)
